Open Source Contribution to Google Spreadsheets

Contribution: Enhanced CSV File Import Feature

In Google Spreadsheets, we are all familiar with the ability to import CSV files, which brings in all the data from the CSV file.

My contribution involves introducing an additional feature to the spreadsheet. This enhancement empowers users to selectively choose specific columns for import from the CSV file.


Here are the steps to follow in order to create a Google Sheets add-on using Google Apps Script:

1. Open Google Sheets:
        Go to Google Sheets by visiting https://sheets.google.com and sign in to your Google account if you're not already logged in.

2. Access Google Apps Script:
        Click on the "Extensions" menu at the top of the Google Sheets interface.
        Select "Apps Script" from the dropdown menu.

3. Create HTML and JavaScript Files:
        In the Google Apps Script editor, click on the "File" menu.
        Choose "New" and then select "HTML" to create an HTML file. Give it a suitable name, such as "index.html."
        Click on the "File" menu again and choose "New" to create a JavaScript file. Give it a relevant name, such as "code.js."

4. Write Code:
        In the "index.html" file, write your HTML and user interface code. This is where you can create a custom user interface for your Google Sheets add-on.
        In the "code.js" file, write your JavaScript code that will handle the functionality of your add-on. This code will interact with the Google Sheets data and implement your desired feature.

5. Save Your Project:
        Be sure to save your project by clicking the floppy disk icon or selecting "File" > "Save" in the Google Apps Script editor. This will ensure your code is saved to your Google Drive.

6. Run the Code:
        In the Google Apps Script editor, click the play button (â–¶) or select "Run" > "Run function" to execute your code. This will deploy and run your add-on.

7. Authorization:
        During the first run, you may be prompted to authorize the script to access your Google Sheets. Follow the prompts to grant the necessary permissions.

8. View Changes in Google Sheets:
        After running the script, you should see the changes or enhancements in your Google Sheets interface based on the functionality you implemented in your code.
